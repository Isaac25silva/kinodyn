python packages needed:

  * python-control http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/python-control/index.php?title=Main_Page
    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-control/files/control-0.5b.tar.gz
    tar -xvf control-0.5b.tar.gz
    cd control-0.5b
    python setup.py install

    * python-control depends on slycot (Python bindings to slicot. slicot requires a fortran compiler)
      git clone git://github.com/avventi/Slycot.git
      cd Slycot
      python setup.py install

  * NetworkX http://networkx.lanl.gov/
  * shapely (can be easily avoided) https://github.com/sgillies/shapely
    * have installed libgeos for speedup

  * cvxopt 
    Won't install with pip or easy_install since setup.py is in the wrong place. 
    Still, use pip to download the build files, navigate to python/build/cvxopt/src and run python setup.py install

  * SciPy/NumPy/Matplotlib

to use IPython's graphical console
Installing PyQt: http://problemssol.blogspot.com/2010/12/compile-and-install-pyqt4-for-python27.html
need libpyside-dev package to install for python2.7 in 10.04:

https://launchpad.net/~pyside/+archive/ppa 
(there is a nicer way to do this. just follow the instuctions on the ppa website)
* add the sources to /etc/apt/source.list
* sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 073700C1
* sudo apt-get update

(still not sure how to get libpyside-python2.7.so)
